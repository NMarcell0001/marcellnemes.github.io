       <h1 id="blogtext" align="center"><b>Teacher's feedback:</b></h1>
       <h2 id="blogtext" align="center"><i>Reading your motivation, nice to see that you are interested in a master program or MBA to get a deeper grasp of ICT. Do you already have any experience on this subject? It is also good that you are open to different tracks of our program. During the second year you will get better acquainted with BIC and DS and will have the chance to make better a choice. </i></h2>
        <h2 id="blogtext" align="center"><i>Interesting that you are already thinking about a management position. Besides programming, our program also focusses on personal development including four general competences every ICT person needs to master, namely 'Interact purposefully', 'Research-oriented problem-solving', 'Future-oriented organizing' and 'Personal leadership'.</i></h2>
        <h2 id="blogtext" align="center"><i>You asked about Maths. Our program for the first year focuses mostly on programming (HTML, JavaScript, TypeScript, Laravel Framework). It is also very hands-on: A class or workshop in the morning, followed by small assignment (individual or in group) and coming back for checkpoint at the afternoon to discuss the findings. Besides, you will get more complex assignments on a weekly basis. There are also team projects during the second, third and fourth quartiles where, next to development, you will also apply a professional way of work (with Agile Scrum methodology).</i> </h2>
        <h2 id="blogtext" align="center"><i>About bikes, I know the APV living quarters have a large parking area for the bikes inside the building. Cycling is a way of life in the Netherlands with lots of bike lanes to crisscross the country: more than 35,000km. Besides it is safe to bike on the roads in the cities too: even in most one-way traffic, bikes are exempted. We may not have mountains, but we do have lots of trails, specially in the natural parks on the costal dunes. </i> </h2>
        <h2 id="blogtext" align="center"><i>And you were right about question 22. Some people need special access card to use the lift, or get more time to complete an exam. If that would be necessary, I would put the student in contact with the dean to make the arrangements as soon as possible.</i> </h2>
        <h2 id="blogtext" align="center"><i>From your SWOT analysis: good that you already have the ability to plan your time and not let things for the last minute. And as I mentioned before, the research-oriented problem-solving may help you to dig deeper into a subject. Not based on a single opinion, but in (other people) relevant studies. </i></h2>
    <h1 id="blogtext" align="center">Feedback to the teacher's feedback:</h1>
    <h2 id="blogtext" align="center"><i>Regarding the future MSc studies (Possible MBA or in IT) my only "background" is my parents working in finance or around that area, plus I've spoken to some professionals in the IT field as well and the general response was when I asked them if I should get a masters degree, a definitive yes. Plus, I've also experienced some form of leadership while being in online communities / groups which in some cases enhanced my skills in that field and which also contributed to my plans on going higher in terms of roles in a company. (Though again, these are just plans  smile)</i> </h2>
    <h2 id="blogtext" align="center"><i>About any relevant "IT" experience; I'd say I'm rather good at win10 troubleshooting as my laptop sometimes decides to get BSODs every now and then, along with lots and lots of errors. Often I just say that whatever I get my hands on will randomly output an error.</i></h2>
    <h2 id="blogtext" align="center"><i>On the biking; I did actually see the 5 day trip they put out somewhere on HZ's website so I guess my interests in this area are covered pleasantly, activity wise.</i></h2>
