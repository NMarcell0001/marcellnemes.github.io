       <h2 id="blogtext" align="center">First of all, I would definitely like to complete a masters program which probably would either be an MBA or something that is related to IT. Second, I would most likely stay in the Netherlands and settle also. Regarding the field of my interests after the program, one of the key facts here is that I probably would choose Business IT Consultant or Data Scientist as my specialization at the beginning of the third year, thus I would most likely advance in that given field, to hopefully achieve a management level role in the coming years. I generally like working with data, whether that is a txt file with hundreds of different informations that I have to organize let's say in python, or a microsoft excel task. In addition, communicating with individuals is also something I am kind of interested in. Regarding the learning path of the next 4 years, I aspire to be able to study by myself on a much more advanced basis, and also I would like to see myself knowing the basis for what I will need in the future, whether that is a skill for a given job or a mindset for learning.</h2>
