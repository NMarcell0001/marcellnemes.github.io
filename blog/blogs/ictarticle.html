    <h2 id="blogtext" align="center">Artifical intelligence, while percieved by the Media as something extremely
        revolutionary, is actually
        a bunch of algorithms that don't really do much other then run if-else loops for eternity. The media overhypes
        it because they gain a lot of views by portraying
        a two letter phrase that the audience can interpret in many ways, especially after all the "movies" about how
        robots will take over the world and such.
        In short, it's fear-mongering and intimidation of a technology that is still in it's baby steps. (Besides, <a
