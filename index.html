    </span><b>Why I think this program suits me:</b></h1>
    
    <h2 id="longfont">
        <ul>

        <li><p><u style="text-underline-offset: 8px; font-size:small;">I enjoy problem solving,
            especially in python which I learnt for about 3-4 years in high school (Thoroughly enjoyed it)</u></p></li>
        <li><p><u style="text-underline-offset: 8px; font-size:small;">I like working with 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data" target="_blank">data</a>, for example in HS we
            basically made automated programs that extracted data from 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file" target="_blank">txt files</a> and did stuff with them</u></p></li>
        </ul>

    <p id="mediumtext"> - I have the motivation to learn new stuff</p>
    <p id="mediumtext"> - I will be glad of feedback and implement (most) in my code</p>

        <p><u style="text-underline-offset: 8px; font-size:small;">Another reason is that when I have an idea I try and code it
            which also involves a lot of learning because of new concepts. A great example is a small program I made this summer
            that calculates the time it will take you to go from point A to point B on a hypothetical rail line, plus, it also
            informs you how many stops you will make along the way. Point A and Point B are given by you and the program is
            pretty flexible since only the distances between each station are given. (AKA there isn't a huge list
            that contains every possible distance from all the stations) (Yes, I am a train nerd as well) The key takeaway from this program I made
            which took about 5-6 workhours is that I was introduced to a new library and had to solve multiple problems that
            required solutions I did not have the knowledge of. Overall it was an awesome experience as the program functions 
            as intended and it doesn't have any bugs. (A huge motivation was the topic of the program which made it 
            rather interesting to me)
